"""ONE compact appendix table for the supervisor's three questions (24 Sep 2026): per method, Model-Avg over sizes of
  Q1 given the domain : macro AUC (subsample) + accuracy with the in-domain threshold
  Q2 domain unknown   : pooled AUC            + accuracy with one threshold tuned on all 9 domains
  Q3 unseen domain    : accuracy with the threshold tuned on the other 8 domains (LODO)   [AUC is unchanged by construction]
Inputs: analysis/logs/subsample_pooled.json (analysis/subsample_pooled.py), analysis/logs/lodo_threshold_check.json (analysis/lodo_threshold_check.py).
